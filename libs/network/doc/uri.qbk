[section:uri The URI]

The library includes a URI object and parser implementation that
allows users of the library to easily interact with different
kinds of valid URI formats.

__uri__ is presented below:
[import uri.cpp]
[boost_network_uri]

Currently the library supports a bare URI implementation that
only parsers the scheme and leaves the scheme specific part as is,
as well as a very liberal HTTP URI parser. The HTTP URI object only
supports absolute URIs that start with either 'http' or 'https'.
