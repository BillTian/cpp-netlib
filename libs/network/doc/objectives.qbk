[section:objectives Objectives]
The objectives of the __cnl__ are to:

* develop a high quality, portable, easy to use C++ networking library
* enable developers to easily extend the library
* lower the barrier to entry for cross-platform network-aware C++
  applications

The goal of __cnl__ has never been to build a fully-featured web
server - there are plenty of excellent options already available.  The
niche that this library targets is for light-weight networking
functionality for C++ applications that have demanding performance
requirements or memory constraints, but that also need to be portable.
This type of application is becoming increasingly common as software
becomes more distributed, and applications need to communicate with
services.

While many languages provide direct library support for high level
network programming, this feature is missing in C++.  Therefore, this
library has been developed with the intention of eventually being
submitted to __boost__, a collection of general, high quality
libraries for C++ developers.

Eventually, __cnl__ will be extended to support many of the
application layer protocols such as SMTP, FTP, SOAP, XMPP etc.
